1.	Using the table description and business rules on the following page, answer or
perform the following:
a.	Identify the Primary Key of the table as it is currently shown.
b.	Identify all of the functional dependencies. Draw the dependency diagram for the initial table showing all dependencies.

2.	Normalize the relation to 3rd Normal Form (3NF).
a.	List of Normalized tables.
b.	Provide a Relational Schema
•	List the normalized tables using the standard table notation:
i.	Tablename (Col1, Col2……Coln)
Primary Key:
Foreign Key:
c.	Provide an E-R Diagram of the tables to be created
d.	Provide an Attribute Chart/Data Dictionary

3. Using the CREATE TABLE command, create each of the normalized tables. Run a 
    DESCRIBE	command for each table.
•	Include the PRIMARY KEY constraint for each table.
•	Include the FOREIGN KEY constraint for each table to which it applies.
•	Include the NOT NULL constraint for Student Name and Instructor Name.
•	Include the CHECK constraint for the Grade to ensure it is one of the 5 acceptable values (A, B, C, D, or F).

4. Code INSERT commands to insert the data from the attached page into the tables you 
    created in 2.
•	Run ‘SELECT * FROM tablename;’ commands to check the contents of your tables.

5. Your output to hand in should include:
•	Question 1, part a.: Primary Key columns
•	Question 1, part b.: Dependency Diagram
•	Question 2, Part a.: List of normalized table descriptions
•	Question 2, Part b.: Dependency diagrams for the normalized tables
•	Question 2, Part c.: E-R Diagram of the tables to be created (Chin or Crow’s Foot)
•	Question 2, Part d.: Relational Schema/Relational Diagram (Page 85 in text)
•	Question 2, Part e.: Attribute Chart/Data Dictionary (Page 221 in text)
•	Question 3: Print out of the CREATE TABLE commands & show resulting SQL 
                                            message.
•	Question 3: Print out of the DESCRIBE table commands & resulting SQL 
                          message.
•	Question 4: Print out of the INSERT commands & Resulting SQL
                          message.
•	Question 4: Print out of the SELECT * FROM tablename listing and SQL
                          results.
